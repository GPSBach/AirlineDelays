### AirlineDelays
Predicting domestic flight delays using the National Weather Services' Rapid Refresh Forecast Model (RAP)

### Overview
Delays and cancellations of flights cost American businesses and consumers an estimated [$27 billion dollars a year](http://airlines.org/dataset/per-minute-cost-of-delays-to-u-s-airlines/).  Weather related delays are a [substantial fraction of total delays](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?pn=1).

Using the [National Weather Services Rapid Refresh model](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-refresh-rap), this project builds a set of classifiers that can predict the likelihood that a given flight will be delayed due to weather conditions.

### Structure

This code is currently under development
* ./data - data used to train the classifiers (largely not backed up on GitHub due to file size).
* ./development - Python3 jupyter notebooks used to build the models and organize the data
* ./src - distribution ready(ish) code
